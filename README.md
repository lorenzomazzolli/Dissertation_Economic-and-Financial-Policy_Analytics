# GDP and Well-being: EU vs USA

This repository contains data and code based on the final dissertation of my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Economics:  
"Limits of GDP as a measure of welfare: A comparison between Europe and the United States".

## Project goals

- Clean and transform raw macroeconomic data (GDP per capita, Public and private expenditure, productivity and labour market, well-being indices)
- Calculate key indicators: GDP per capita ratios, annual growth rates, cumulative growth rates
- Visualize data using Power BI, R and Python
- Showcase dashboard and scripts used in the dissertation

## Structure

- `data/raw`: original Excel files (sources: Eurostat, BEA, OECD)
- `data/processed`: cleaned datasets and KPIs
- `src`: Python scripts (ETL, KPI calculations)
- `reports`: final dashboards, visuals, documentation

## Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Power BI
- R (ggplot2)
- SQL (SQLite)
